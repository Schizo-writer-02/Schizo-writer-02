I read responses of my groupmates about the course at my university.
One of the thing that has lingered for approximately 8 hours is a sentence
that I love English language. As it is quite hard to me to accept praise,
I do not usually pay attention to any comments.
However, this one is completely different! Thank you, Tatyana!
